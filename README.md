# Langton's Ant
This program runs the traditional Langton's Ant algorithm using 5 randomized colors, as well as turn directions that are randomized at the beginning of each simulation. Random picking of turn directions are optimized to prevent starting values that cause the simulation to get caught in an confined loop in the beginning of the simulation. Simulation can be reset via r key.
